Took Rickshaw to Vikhroli. shoes was given to me by Vikas as i didn't had trekking shoe. Booked Auto Rickshaw with Uber and I got know from Vikas that Uber price is lower compare to ola, Reached Bandra, waited for train, bought some choclate and candy. It was not good candy. 
Bought tea. It was the worst tea we ever had. We couldn't even drink it like water and we had to throw the tea. We said to ourself that we won't drink the tea in train.

We reached Delhi in the morning and we were able to catch the Haldwani train. Tere were no free breakfast due to covid. We took chain and poha. Poha making was intresting He unrap the packet and put some boling water in it and it's read after 2-3 minutes. taste was ok. We didn't get news paper also. Reached Haldwani and took taxi for darshani village , Garud. Luckely we were on time an there was already one taxi availabe for Garud and driver was also from Garud. Normally It takes around 5-6 hours to reach Garud but we were late becuase of there were traffic on bridges. There was one more passanger with us who was plaing local songs. He had Pizza shop in Garud. We stopped for lunch thoug lunch was not great but however we were able to see mountains covered with snow. We also stopped before 5-10km of dharshani village to drik nature water from mountains. It was cold and tasty water. Around 6-7PM were near by our frnds home he was standing out with mobile flash light and we were able to identfy him. finally we reached, freshed up and had dinner on upgraded table :).

After dinner we started planing for kedarnath and decieded to wake around 4.30AM and leave by 5.30AM because we had only one buy around 6AM from village.
