Took Rickshaw to Vikhroli. shoes was given to me by Vikas as i didn't had trekking shoe. Booked Auto Rickshaw with Uber and I got know from Vikas that Uber price is lower compare to ola, Reached Bandra, waited for train, bought some choclate and candy. It was not good candy. 
Bought tea. It was the worst tea we ever had. We couldn't even drink it like water and we had to throw the tea. We said to ourself that we won't drink the tea in train.
