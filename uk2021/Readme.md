We reached Delhi in the morning and we were able to catch the Haldwani train. Tere were no free breakfast due to covid. We took chain and poha. Poha making was intresting He unrap the packet and put some boling water in it and it's read after 2-3 minutes. taste was ok. We didn't get news paper also. Reached Haldwani and took taxi for darshani village , Garud. Luckely we were on time an there was already one taxi availabe for Garud and driver was also from Garud. Normally It takes around 5-6 hours to reach Garud but we were late becuase of there were traffic on bridges. There was one more passanger with us who was playing local songs. He had Pizza shop in Garud. We stopped for lunch thoug lunch was not great but however we were able to see mountains covered with snow. 


We also stopped before 5-10km of dharshani village to drik nature water from mountains. It was cold and tasty water. Around 6-7PM were near by our frnds home he was standing out with mobile flash light and we were able to identfy him. finally we reached, freshed up and had dinner on upgraded table :).

After dinner we went to see "Ramlila" which was happening one of the nearby school and It was very cold weather. We bought 4 Mongfali packet and sat in middle of the stage. We were watching the Ramlila and eating Mongfali.

We waked up aroubd 5AM and Freshed up and went to Garud bus stop. We had vegitables sandwitch(cucumber, onion and Magical chatuney) and taste was amazing. We waited around 30 minutes after that bus came. We took the bus and it was very crowded bus. We earlier thought we will get the seat but it wasn't like that. We were standing the whole time. Some people were vomiting because of bus motion sickness. However the sunsire was purely orangy color and beutiful.

We reached Rudraprayag around 12PM and then took another bus to reach Guptkashi around 1PM and from here we took bus for Sonprayag(Kedarnath) but before 23KM they have closed all the Kedharnath Phatak and check post.
Because Weather Forcast was not good for next 3 days rains (17, 18 and 19 Dec 2021). It also started raining little bit also. It was very sad moment for us but we wanted to go Kedharnath. We took some photos nearby rivers and had tea near by local shop. We got to know from locals that there is way to go besides river by walking and we took that route and reached the other side of check post. We had lunch there we were very hungry.

After the lunch we takled to locals and found out everything is closed :( and we will not able to go Kedarnath. We decided to Tungnath. We had to take multiple cab to get there but hard part was wating for cab as it was raning there was less cab and fair was high. There was funny moment in catching last cab it was raning the the cab driver was asking for some higher amount but we said we have lots of time to wait and we will take share cab. We waited there for 20 min and had some sweet snacks and then it started raining. Tungnath is around 12000ft as we were approacing at high the weather got cold and cold and cold. We asked for rooms as well but most of them were full or not good. This is because all kedarnath yatri came here. Finally we rached the road end and get out for cab. OMG!!! outer side was too cold. We can feel the cold it's frezzeing our head and I could not stand in one place for more than 5 second. Anyhow We booked one room and got freshed. It's was very hard to even wash your face with that cold water. It was frezzing.

We went for dinner around 8PM and we eat alot and food was good. While talking we could see some fog comming out of our mouth.
