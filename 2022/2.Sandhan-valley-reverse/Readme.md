# Sandhan valley - The unseen Reverse water fall
 
### Date : 25-06-2022 6:03AM
 
One of our friends borrowed a car from another friend and we decided on friday night to go somewhere which eventually turned out to be Bhandardara and Sandhan valley for watching the The Reverse waterfall.
Ok this was the first time where almost everyone came on time(1-3 minute delay) but i think it wasn't our luck to reach on central point on time as somehow while going to central point one of the bike chain lay down and we had to wait and walk around 200 meter.
 
Finally the car wala friend came and we started our journey. Every Time there was a toll plaza we started talking about how local authorities were taking money and there is no maintenance on the road.
 
So the first thing we had to do was find one of the "theeka chatni wala idli" which we couldn't find. We searched for a new idli dosa shop and there was no dosa but idli was good with one different chatni. every one had eaten 2 plates. Went to another shop that had chai(maybe more chemical) and some friends had samosa as well.
 
Saw Gavlidev trek again in route and after some time we stopped at nearby kasara to have tea and breakfast but nothing was good the bhajiya was simply besan with a limited amount of onion. It started raining heavily and at same time we were booking some online orders because there was online sales. We were listening to some songs on a bluetooth speaker and singing along.
 
 
reached bhandardara there were lots of waterfalls and lot's of crowds as well. Took some photos and a swimmer friend started looking for a place to swim nearby. There were police and swimming was banned due to rainfall. We also had "bhutta" and local chai.
 
Saw one well near by temple. The well water was kind of blue and also drinking water for village. The temple structure had 2 elephant statues at the top of the entry gate.
There were cows nearby as well.

Had round of bhandardara dam on rented boat. Everyone went to the edge of the boat and stood for photos also for view. a few times we had to move the right and left side to manage the boat levels. It took 15 minutes. There was one small place where 2 friends swimmed. It started raining and we ran toward the car. Everyone was wet though.
had some vadapav(which was not good) + namkeen and laayi + chai. continued our journey toward Sandhan valley.(before that there was entry fee of 100 per car , 30 per person)

Finally reached Sandhan valley, again took a 30 rupee per person ticket and parked our car. It was almost 5PM and we were thinking it would take 2-3 hours to come back but the reverse waterfall was a 10-15 min walk way. everywhere we could see only fog and sometimes we could not see more than 2 meters due to fog. Finally we reached the reverse waterfall and could see some of the water shower coming from below but it was not a good view of the reverse waterfall but everything around was beautiful. While coming back we lost the route due to fog and managed to get back on track in no time.

 
Started our return journey and took the wrong route :(, there were lots of potholes we couldn't go above 10km/h. It was more than 7 km of bad road. finally got to the highway but due to our bad luck one of our right back tire was punctured and luckily there was puncture wala nearby which did not have tool but also another puncture wala which had all tools. We had to replace tube(950+60+60) as well. Due to this incident we got to eat tasty food at a nearby restaurant. Also coming back we went to some unseen pot holes.
