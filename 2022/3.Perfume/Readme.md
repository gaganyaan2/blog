# How to make Perfume?

## Basic perfume formula

[Ethnol + Base + DPG oil + Distilled water] + (Compund + Perfume essential oil + custom )= Perfume

70%                                         + 30%

[            15-45 Days                   ] + [ 2-14 days ]


## Bases

1. ISO E Super (woody)
2. Lyral
3. Helional
4. Methyl Ionone
5. Polysantol
6. Galaxolide (musk, earlier used to come for musk deer)
7. Hedione (floral .eg. jasmin flow in air)

- Type : woody, floral, powdery

Aldehyde = heavy carbon molecule = stay long

## Premix (Ethnol + Base + DPG oil + Distilled water)

1. Base(Galaxolide) - 5%
2. DPG - 5%
3. Distilled water - 2.5%
4. Hedion - 0.5 %
5. IOSE - 0.05 %

eg. 800g ethnol + 40g Galaxolide + 20g water + 40g DPG + 4g hedion + 0.4g ISOE

## C series citrus (top notes)

Lemon 

Lemon grass 

C8 - Organge

C16 - Strawberry

## Syntactic Or essential oil 
- Top and Mid notes based on molecular weight.

## Accord (like musical notes)

Rose   - 1 2 3 ...

Jasmin - 9 8 7 ...

## Notes
It's all based on the **molecular weight** of the compounds. light weight used in top notes and heavy weight can be used in mid and base notes.
eg sandarwool can be base note.


#### Top notes
- generally Citrus (lemon, organge)
- Ginger root oil, Citral, coumarin, linalool, bergamot

#### Mid notes
- hydroxycitronellal, alpha ionone, Eugenol , Geraniol(rose), polysantol, D.H.M(Dihydromyrcenol), Calone(watermelon)

#### Base notes
- 7 base notes above
- benzyl benzoate, farnesol, oakmoss, Cedrol
- 

## Others

1. Ambroxen - amber woody - ealier used to come from whale
2. tonalide - powdery musk
- if odor strength is high needs to be diluted in DPG, Ethnol, etc.- generally 10%
- Absolute oils - produced through solvent extraction, or more traditionally, through enfleurage
