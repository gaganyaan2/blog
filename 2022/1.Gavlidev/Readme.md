We were thinking about to go somewhere on 24th evening and one of our friend sugested that he have seen small trek near by Ghansholi road. Today we went there and we got to name of the place "Galvidev". Actauly it's mix of small temple + Bird Sanctuary + Waterfall. The entry gate is Beautiful. We took left from entry gate. it's very normal trek. We saw well.

At top It was very windy and peaceful. We sat there for more than 25 min. We talked about solar panel, Motar , how everything is connected to motor. If motor was not invented.

While coming down we took diffrent route and couldn't find path ahead. There was one type of grass which was giving totally diffrent kind of itcing.
one of my friend saw small snake but We couldn't see and we were sad about it. We also saw lots of neem tree.
