# Gavlidev small trek 

### Date : 25-06-2022 8:30AM

We were thinking about going somewhere on the 24th evening and one of our friends suggested that he had seen a small trek near Ghansoli road. Today we went there and we got to know the name of the place "<strong>Gavlidev</strong>". Actually it's a mix of a small temple + Bird Sanctuary + Waterfall. The entry gate is Beautiful. We took left from the entry gate. It's a very normal trek. We saw water well.

It took around 1 hours to fully climb the trek(some places unexplored). We can see a very beautiful separation of <strong>City</strong> and <strong>Nature</strong>. We saw airplanes playing hide and seek in the clouds.

At top It was very windy and peaceful. We sat there for more than 25 min. We talked about solar panels, Motar , how everything is connected to motors. If the motor was not invented.

While coming down we took different route and couldn't find the path ahead. There was one type of grass which was giving a totally different kind of itching.One of my friends saw a small snake but We couldn't see it and we were sad about it. We also saw lots of <strong>Neem</strong> trees.
